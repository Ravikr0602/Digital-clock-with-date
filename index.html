    <!-- this article you are going to learn how to make a digital clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming code. Earlier I shared with you many more types of analog and digital clock-making methods. In this article, I have shown you how to make a completely simple digital watch design.

    There are basically two types of clock, an analog and a digital. Digital clocks are much easier to make than analog clocks. In this watch, I have added a date with time, not just time. That means together you will see time, date, month, date everything. This design is based on JavaScript programming code. If you know the basic JavaScript programming code then you will definitely know how to make this design.
   
    As you can see in the picture above, I have created a box on a page here. I have given a white border around that box. I have blackened the background of the box so that the numbers i.e. time on the black background can be seen clearly. As you can see above, there is a place for everyone to see for the first time. During this time you will see hours, minutes, and seconds. It has AM and PM options. Below the time is the place to show the month, day, and date. All this will be the same with the time of your device. -->
